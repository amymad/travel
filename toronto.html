<h1>Toronto</h1>
<h3>I travelled to Toronto with John in November 2021 as a business trip. 
    <br>It was our first time doing this and we're so lucky John's job paid for our travel and accomodation and some food costs. 
    <br>Without this we certainly couldn't afford to spend a month in such an expensive city! 
    <br>John was working throughout the trip but we still managed to fit in some fun on evenings and at the weekends, including a trip to Niagara.</h3>

Toronto is such an exciting city to visit with so many cool bars and cafes to chill in and more shops than even I could handle. <br>
People are friendly and public transport is easy so I'd reccomend it to solo travellers as well as groups. </p>
<h3>Museum</h3>
<p>We really enjoyed our visit to the museum, unfortunately the dinosaur section was closed (usually our favourite part of any museum)
but we still had a great time. I spent ages looking at the shiny rocks!<br>
The gift shop had some really interesting stuff, very expensive though as always!</p>

<h3>Shopping</h3>
<p>As we were there for the whole of November and I had a lot of time on my own I decided to do all of my Xmas shopping while there. <br>
This included some designer purchases, toiletries and kids stuff. <br>
Shopping malls<br>
There are so many malls in Toronto and great transport links to all of them! I visited most of them! <br>
    The main one if you don't have a whole day to spend shopping is the Eaton centre, this is in the middle of Toronto close to everything and has all the shops you could need!<br>
My favourite mall was the Dufferin mall. Definitely take the opportunity to explore Bloor St West on the way for really quirky shops. The Monkey's Paw is awesome for unusual old books. <br>
        Dufferin has loads of outlet stores, kids shops and a giant Walmart. I went back several times and always left in an Uber due to buying too much!<br>
 Yorkville is the place to go for the real high end designer shopping if you've got some serious money to spend.<br></p></div>

We had a bit of a last minute panic when it came to our accomodation, the hotel we were booked into cancelled on the morning we were travelling. <br>
Luckily for us I managed to get a last minute booking via air bnb for a beautiful apartment in Yorkville, we had stunning views over towards casa loma from the 28th floor. <br>
Yorkville was a lovely place to stay, lots of fancy restaurants and shops around there and the car spotting is great fun but if you're looking for somewhere a bit more exciting I'd reccomend staying somewhere downtown where all the cool bars and cafes are. <br>
Pretty much anywhere you stay in central Toronto is great as ubers are cheap and easy to get and its really easy to use the Subway.</p></div>

Best food in toronto has to be Saigon Lotus. Their mock meats are amazing especially the BBQ noodles! <br>
We ate in the restaurant and had takeaway multiple times and everything we had was great. <br>
Great place just to stop off for a Vietnamese coffee too!
My second favourite place to eat was Planta, much pricier but definitely worth it. <br>
Their pasta dishes are to die for and the wine menu is also worth a look. <br>
Most of the food we had in Toronto was pretty impressive but we were let down when we ate at the CN tower. The meal with a few drinks came to around $300 so its certainly not somewhere for everyday! John booked for us to go as he wanted to propose to me somewhere special! <br> 
The view was amazing and the service was good but in terms of food it was probably the worst meal we had on our whole trip!</p></div>

Our favourite bar was Storm Crow Manor, the food was great with lots of plates we could share and the cocktails were amazing! <br>
The overall vibe of the place was super cool and great for pictures. </p></div>
