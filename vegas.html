<h1> Viva Las Vegas</h1>
<h3>I travelled to Las Vegas in August 2019 for my dads wedding to his beautiful wife Deb.<br>
     We travelled as a group of 14 adults and 2 babies. It was 6 years in the making but so worth the wait! <br>
     We had a rented house for a week together, John and I stayed for an additional 3 nights at Park MGM so we could experience the strip a bit more!</h3><br>

        <p>When thinking Vegas the first thing on everyone’s mind is of course the casinos! We had a great time gambling throughout our stay but with all there is to see and do this really isn’t the main part of a Vegas adventure for us! Below is a list of other things we enjoyed:</p>
     <h3>Mob museum</h3>
    	<p>
            Really interesting experience hearing all the stories of the mob and how things used to be in Vegas. There are three options when booking of extras to experience whilst there, we chose to do the firearm training simulator which I’d highly recommend!
                <br> *As the museum is located downtown take the opportunity to explore the area while there* 
        </p>
     <h3>Downtown</h3>
     <p>
        Downtown Vegas is definitely not for the faint hearted! In the daytime its fairly normal, in the evening however it’s a bizarre experience! Street performers get weirder by the minute, its certainly an interesting place to people watch. <br>
        The container park was one of our favourite spots, we came across it when wondering about and fell in love. They have lots of little shops and bars and in the middle is a stage, the night we went they had Karaoke. 
     </p>
     <h3>Day trip to Grand Canyon </h3>
        <p>Its just one of those places you have to see! We booked a tour with Comedy on Deck, it was supposed to include hoover dam but we didn’t stop there (I can’t remember why). It did include a proper American breakfast at a little café which was great. We chose to add on the Skywalk and get a photo package, I personally really enjoyed it because I got to laugh at my scared family members, but if you’re not scared or with anyone who is the experience isn’t all that. 
        </p>
     <h3>Shops</h3>
        <p>Now there really is something for everyone in Vegas when it comes to shopping. There are several malls on the strip itself with those American classics you just have to visit such as Sephora and Bath and Body works but then there are also stores I’ve never seen before. <br>
         One of our favourites was the coca-cola store. They had all of the usual merch but upstairs is a café where you can try a selection of coca-cola products from across the world. We loved rating each one! Next door is the M&Ms store which is also a must to grab a pick n’ mix. <br>
         Just a short Lyft/Uber from the strip there are the north and south outlet malls. If you’re into designer goods these are certainly worth the trip. Lots of great discounts and offers.

        The house we rented was amazing, it was awesome being away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and enjoying family time. We had 9 bedrooms, a cinema room, outdoor pool and jacuzzi. The place was huge! We stocked the fridges with lots of cheap drinks from Walmart and got all our snacks and breakfast food in nice and cheap. 
        My dad found it on vrbo.com.<br>
        We spent our extra days at Park MGM, not one of the flashiest on the strip but a perfect base for exploring. The rooms were spacious and modern, it had a few decent options for quick food in the mornings and the casino had all the best games. We didn’t pay for our stay as we used points we’d accrued playing for free on myVEGAS slots. All we had to cover was the resort fee!<br>
        Our next visit we plan to stay at Planet Hollywood as its got the best shopping mall in it and is right in the middle of the strip. We have a lot of myVEGAS points saved up but want to use them on show tickets and food discounts next time.

        Being veggie in Vegas has its drawbacks for sure, I had a shock when I went to McDonalds for a quick meal and found absolutely nothing I could eat! Our experience in Benihana wasn’t much fun either but that’s a story for another day!<br>
        We did find the takeaway options were amazing though. Particularly Café no Fur which had the most amazing burgers we’ve ever had. <br>
        Capos was a great night out, proper American Italian food in a speakeasy setting. The room is pretty dark which gives it a cool vibe and they have live singers on. <br>
        Hard rock café, pretty much the same as it is everywhere, good cocktails and good food, not cheap but always a stop off for us to get a t-shirt!

<p>
Fat Tuesdays was the best, they have stores within some of the hotels on the strip. Its basically an alcoholic slushie, I got one of the massive cups which you can take back to any of their stores for a refill cheaper than getting a new cup each time.<br> 
Dicks Last Resort. We stopped off for a few drinks here just to people watch and it didn’t disappoint! The staff give diners a paper hat to wear with an insulting name on describing them. <br>
Carlos and Charlies, we got a Wowcher deal for food and unlimited drinks. The food was standard and the drinks were strong. I’d recommend for a cheap night out.
