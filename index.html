        <p>
            I've been passionate about travel my whole life and have travelled to 21 countries and counting!
        <br> The aim was to reach 30 before 30 but with Covid that unfortunately didnt happen so the new plan is 40 before 40.  
        <br> I regularly do trips around Europe and love to plan longer trips when I get the opportunity to travel further afield. 
        <br> I love wildlife and have had the honor to visit amazing places like Nepal and Costa Rica. 
        <br> City breaks are also great fun, I've been to Paris 5 times now and can't wait to get back to Las Vegas!
        <br> My next adventure is a few days back in Prague then off to Sweden on 23rd April.
